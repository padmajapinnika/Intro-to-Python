# Intro to Python Course

This repository contains my exercises and deliverables for the Intro to Python course.

## Repository Structure

- **Exercise 1.1/**  
  Contains files related to Exercise 1.1 such as scripts, requirements, screenshots, and learning journal.

## What I Have Done So Far

- **Set up Python Environment:**  
  Installed Python 3.8.7 and configured virtual environments using `virtualenvwrapper-win`. Created a base virtual environment named `cf-python-base` for managing Python packages.

- **Created Python Script:**  
  Developed a simple script `add.py` that takes two numbers as input from the user, adds them, and prints the result.

- **Installed and Used IPython:**  
  Installed the `ipython` package inside my virtual environment to enhance the interactive Python shell experience with features like syntax highlighting and autocomplete.

- **Generated Requirements File:**  
  Used `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to create a requirements file listing all installed packages in my environment for easy replication.

- **Set Up Second Virtual Environment:**  
  Created another virtual environment called `cf-python-copy` and installed all required packages from `requirements.txt` to ensure consistent environment setup.

- **Organized Project Folder:**  
  Created folders for exercises inside my project directory to keep deliverables (scripts, screenshots, journals, etc.) well-structured.

- **Started Using Git and GitHub:**  
  Initialized Git in my project folder, connected it to a remote GitHub repository, and pushed my code and folders for version control and collaboration.

## Learning Journal

Each exercise folder includes a learning journal documenting what I have learned and my coding experience for that exercise.

## How to Use

- Navigate to the exercise folder you want to review.
- Open scripts or documents related to that exercise.
- Run Python scripts within their respective virtual environments if applicable.
